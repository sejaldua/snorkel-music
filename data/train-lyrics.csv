On top of the world but I still can't breathe
Every time you walk into the room my heart skip a beat

I Still think about all of the things that we did
Sometimes I think it's all my head
Sometimes I wish I could just forget you but I can't

I still wonder who's giving you all of your love
Sometimes I think I wanna give up
Sometimes I wish I could just forget you but I can't
No I can't cos I
Still think about when we

Cause I can't get over
No I can't can't over
No I can't get over
No I can't get over you

Do I deserve a shred of worth or am I

All we do is, all we do is chase the day

All we do is lie and wait
All we do is, all we do is lie and wait
All we do is feel the fade
All we do is, all we do is feel the fade

I've been upside down
I don't wanna be the right way round
Can't find paradise on the ground
I've been upside down

God knows where I would be if you hadn't found me
Sitting all alone in the dark
A dumb screenshot of youth
Watch how a cold broken teen will desperately lean
Upon a superglued human of proof

What the hell would I be without you? (What the hell would I be?)
Brave face, talk so lightly, hide the truth (Hide the truth)

'Cause I'm sick of losing soulmates
So where do we begin?
I can finally see you're as fucked up as me
So how do we win?
Yeah, I'm sick of losing soulmates
Won't be alone again
